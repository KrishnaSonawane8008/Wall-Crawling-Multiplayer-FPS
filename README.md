This was mad with Godot v4.2.1 stable

<h1>The Concept</h1>
This is a proof-of-concept for a multiplayer First Person Shooter where you play as a mechanical spider which can shoot lazers and can swing around and crawl around in the environment. The game rules are the same as traditional FPS games where the goal is to shoot the opponent, the twist is the it allows the player to use the entire environment as a traversable space hence providing a lot more freedom of movement. 
<br>
<br>
The players can walk on walls, arches, or really any surface on the map, in addition to that the players can also grappel to a close enough surface where normally, reaching via crawling would take time. All of these mechanics combined allow for player tricks which enhance the regular FPS experience.
